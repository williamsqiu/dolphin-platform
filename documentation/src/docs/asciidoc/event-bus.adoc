= The Event Bus

Dolphin Platform provides an event bus that can be used to send events to client sessions on the server. By doing so
it's quite easy to create dynamic application with the Dolphin Platform that automatically propagate information to
several clients. A good example for such an application is a messaging app in that all messages that are typed by a user
will be directly visible in the client instances of several other users.

== General overview of the event bus

The event bus of Dolphin Platform can only be used on the server. It's part of the basic server module
(dolphin-platform-server`) and therefore no special dependencies need to be added to a Dolphin Platform application to
use the event bus. The event bus implements the publish-subscribe-pattern and can be used to send events to all
subscribers of a specific topic.

To do so a Dolphin Platform controller (or other beans that live in the Dolphin Platform client scope) can be registered
as subscriber for a specific topic. Any managed bean of an application can send custom events to a defined topic. By
doing so all subscribers will be notified and receive the event. The event can contain custom data which allows a
developer to send informations to several controller instances.

== Defining a topic

As already mentioned the Dolphin Platform event bus is topic based. This means that all event must be published to a
specified topic and all receivers are always subscribed to a topic. In Dolphin Platform the topic is not simply
defined by a String but by the `Topic<E>` class. By doing so the topic can already define what types of data can be send
to this topic based on the generic identifier. Since topics are used at the publisher and the receiver site it's best
practice to define them as constants. Here is an example how topics can be specified:

[source,java]
----
public interface EventTopics {

    public static final Topic<String> DESCRIPTION_ADDED_TOPIC = new Topic();
    
    public static final Topic<MyCustomBean> DATA_CHANGED_TOPIC = new Topic();

}
----

In this example only items of type `MyCustomBean` can be send to the `DATA_CHANGED_TOPIC` topic. Internally the topic
uses an unique identifier for specification. A developer can define it's own identifier by simply passing a `String` to
the constructor of the `Topic`. This is useful for debugging since you can see a readable name of the topic but in that
case a developer must check that all topics have unique identifiers:

[source,java]
----
public interface EventTopics {

    public static final Topic<String> DESCRIPTION_ADDED_TOPIC = new Topic("descriptionAddedTopic");
    
    public static final Topic<MyCustomBean> DATA_CHANGED_TOPIC = new Topic("dataChangedTopic");

}
----

== Sending an event

The Dolphin Platform provides an injectable `DolphinEventBus` bean that must be used to send an event to a topic. By
doing so each bean that is managed by the underlying container (like Spring or JavaEE) can publish events. To publish an
event you always need to define the topic to that the event should be published. In addition data can be sent as part of
the event message. Publishing an event is a non-blocking operation. Here is an example how a event can be sent to a
specific topic:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyLocalStoreService {
 
    @Inject
    private DolphinEventBus eventBus;
    
    public void addDescription(String desc) {
        eventBus.publish(EventTopics.DESCRIPTION_ADDED_TOPIC, desc);
    }

    public void updateData(MyCustomBean data) {
        eventBus.publish(EventTopics.DATA_CHANGED_TOPIC, data);
    }

}
----

In this example the previously created topics are used. As you can see data of the type that is defined in the generic
identifier of the `Topic<E>` instances is sent to the topic. Sending another type of data (an instance of a different
class) will end in a compiler exception.

== Receiving events

To receive events of a specific topic the receiver must subscribe itself to the topic. This is done by adding a message
listener to the topic. This listener will be called whenever a new event was published for the given topic. Since the
event handling is always done in a Dolphin Platform communication roundtrip an event receiver must be a Dolphin Platform
controller or a managed bean that is defined by the client scope. The following controller class shows how a subscription
can be done:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @DolphinModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @Inject
    private DolphinEventBus eventBus;
    
    @PostContruct
    public void init() {
        eventBus.subscribe(EventTopics.DATA_CHANGED_TOPIC, e -> {
                System.out.println("Data changed: " e.getData().getName();
        });
        
        eventBus.subscribe(EventTopics.DESCRIPTION_ADDED_TOPIC, e -> {
                model.getDescriptions().add(e.getData());
        });
    }
}
----

As you can see the listener can simply access the data that was sent to the topic by using `event.getData()`. Thanks to
the typesafety of the event bus the data doesn' t need to be casted to the needed type. In the example you can see one big
benefit of the event bus: Since all Dolphin Platform model instances will automatically be shared and synchronized between
client and server the changes of the model that are done in the subscription of the `DESCRIPTION_ADDED_TOPIC` topic will
automatically be snychronized with the client and can trigger an update of the UI. By doing so it's quite easy to update
several clients dynamically based on events.

The `DolphinEventBus` doesn't provide a method to unregister subscriptions. Instead of this the `subscribe(...)` methods
return an object of type `Subscription`. This object can easily be used to unsubscribe from a topic. By doing so the
following code defines a controller that can be dynamically subscribed and unsubscribed from a topic:

[source,java]
----
@DolphinController(ControllerConstants.CONTROLLER_NAME)
public class MyViewController {
 
    @DolphinModel
    private MyModel model;
    
    @Inject
    private DolphinEventBus eventBus;
    
    private Subscription subscription;
    
    @DolphinAction
    public void activateLiveUpdates() {
        if(subscription != null) {
            subscription = eventBus.subscribe(EventTopics.DESCRIPTION_ADDED_TOPIC, e -> {
                    model.getDescriptions().add(e.getData());
            });
        }
    }
    
    @DolphinAction
    public void deactivateLiveUpdates() {
        if(subscription != null) {
            subscription.unsubscribe();
            subscription = null;
        }
    }
}
----

== Session filtering for events

When publishing an event to the event bus a filter can be defined. By doing so the filter will decide to what client
sessions the event should be published. By doing so it's quite easy to send an event only to the current client session
or to all client sessions in the current HTTP session (this will infect all tabs in a browser, for example).

To do so an implementation of the `EventSessionFilter` interface must be defined. This filter will check all client
session that are subscriped to the given topic and can avoid that the event will be published tonthe given client session.

A basic implementation of the `EventSessionFilter` interface that will allow only one client session to receive events
might look like this:
[source,java]
----
public class OneClientSessionFilter implements EventSessionFilter {

    private final String clientSessionId;

    public OneClientSessionFilter(final String clientSessionId) {
        this.clientSessionId = clientSessionId;
    }

    public boolean shouldHandleEvent(String sessionId) {
        return clientSessionId.equals(sessionId);
    }
}
----

Such an event filter can no be used when an event will be published. To do so the Dolphin Platform event bus provides
a method to publish an event to a specific topic by using such a filter:

[source,java]
----
eventBus.publish(myTopic, myData, myFilter);
----


== Use-cases for the event bus

There are several use cases and scenarios that can simply be developed by using the Open Dolphin event bus.
TODO

== Using a distributed event bus

Since the Dolphin Platform can be installed in a cluster by using sticky sessions the default implementation of the
event bus will not work in such a scenario. In that case a distributed event bus is needed. The Dolphin Platform provides
the optional module `dolphin-platform-distributed-eventbus` that adds such an alternative event bus that is based on
Hazelcast (TODO: Link). Once this module is added to a server application the Dolphin Platform can be configured to use
the distributed event bus instead of the default implementation. A developer do not need to change any source code in
that case since the interface of the Dolphin Platform event bus will be still the same. Only the injected implementation
is a different one. To activate the distributed event bus the following configuration property must be set in the
`dolphin.properties` file (or by using Spring configuration):
----
eventbusType=distributed
----
Once this configuration is set Hazelcast will be used internally to provide a distributed event bus. Since each event bus
instance (1 by server runtime) is defined as a Hazelcast client a remote Hazelcast server must be running. The Dolphin
Platform event bus will automatically connect the internal Hazelcast client to the Hazelcast server and use it to distribute
events to several server runtimes.

=== Hazelcast configuration

If the distributed event bus is used a Hazelcast server is needed. All application instances that use the distributed
event bus will automatically create a connection to that server. Such a connection must be configured. To do so a developer
can define the following parameters in the `dolphin.properties` file:

.Table title
|===
|Name |Description |Supported values |Default value

|hazelcast.server.name
|Defines the host name of the Hazelcast server.
|any string that defines the host name of the hazelcast server
|localhost

|hazelcast.server.port
|Defines the port of the Hazelcast server.
|a valid port number
|5701

|hazelcast.group.name
|Defines the name of the Hazelcast group that should be used
|a String
|micro-landscape
|===

NOTE: Currently this values can only be specified in the `dolphin.properties` file. The Dolphin Platform provides an
integration in Spring configuration to configure the common properties of the Dolphin Platform. This is currently not
possible for the Hazelcast integration (see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/issues/377[this issue]). In
addtion a already defined Hazelcast client that is provided by Spring or JavaEE as a managed bean can not be used
(see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/issues/378[this issue]).


=== Specification of the distributed event bus protocol

The distributed event bus communicates over hazelcast by sending and receiving events in JSON. To provide
communication with other Canoo and 3rd Party frameworks we specified the JSON that defines an event of the
distributed event bus. Both Canoo frameworks Dolphin Platform and ULC provide an implementation of an
distributed event bus that is based on version 1.0 of this spec.

==== Shared events specification 1.0

Currently the spec defines 2 parts:
- Hazelcast must be configured to understand the type of events
- A specific JSON schema is defined that specifies the structure of an event

To send an event that should be interpreted by Dolphin Platform or ULC the type of the event mus be defined as `com.canoo.platform.remoting.server.event.MessageEvent`. This can easily be done in the hazelcast config. Dolphin Platform automatically uses this type for all events.

Next to the type all messages that are send to hazelcast must be defined as a JSON string. To do so the spec defines the JSON schema:

[source,json]
----
{
	"type" : "object",
	"properties" : {
		"shared-event-spec-version" : {"type" : "string"},
		"data" : {"type" : "string"},
		"context" : {"$ref" : "#/definitions/context"},
	},
	"definitions" : {
		"metadata" : {
			"properties" : {
                "key" : {"type" : "string"},
                "value" : {"type" : "string"}
            }
		},
		"context" : {
			"type" : "object",
			"properties" : {
				"topic" : {"type" : "string"},
				"timestamp" : {"type" : "number"},
				"metadata" : {"type": "array", "items": {"$ref" : "#/definitions/metadata"}}
			}
		}
	}
}
----


For version 1.0 of the specification the `shared-event-spec-version` property of the root object must contain exactly `1.0`. Next to this the `data` property of the root element and the `value` property of the metadata object are specified as base64 encoded. By doing so any serializable data can be defined in this properties.
