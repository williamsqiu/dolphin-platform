= Dolphin Platform IntelliJ Plugin

We provide a plugin for IntelliJ that creates getter & setter methods for the bean model of
Dolphin Platform. Like the JavaFX properties you need more than a simple getter and setter to
get the full power out of the Dolphin Platform properties and collections. To simplify the access
we created a plugin for IntelliJ that creates all needed methods for you.

== Installing the Plugin

To install the Plugin you need to open the "Preferences" dialog in IntelliJ. In that dialog go
to the "Plugin" section as shown in the following picture:

.IntelliJ Preferences

In this dialog you must click the "Browse repositories..." Button in the bottom. By doing so you
can search in the IntelliJ repository for plugins that are not added to your IntelliJ installation.
The dialog provides a search field. Once you start typing "Dolphin" in the search field the Dolphin
Platform plugin will be found:

.IntelliJ Plugin

You only need to click the green install button in the plugin description to install the Dolphin
Platform plugin to your IDE.

== Use the Plugin

To be true there is nothing special that you need to know :) By adding the plugin IntelliJ will
automatically detect Dolphin Platform properties and collections and create all methods for you
by using the default functionality to create getter & setter.

The following screen shows a class that defines 2 Dolphin Platform properties.

By opening the "Generate" popup you can now trigger the "Getter and Setter" action as always.
The following dialog shows the 2 properties that part of the class. By selecting both IntelliJ
will create all getter / setter methods for you:
