= Dolphin Platform release documentation
The sources of the Dolphin Platform are seperated in several repositories:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform[GitHub repository of the Java API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[GitHub repository of the JavaScript basic client API]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[GitHub repository of the Polymer client API]

In addition we provide several repositories that contain jumpstarts for the Dolphin Platform. This repositories
should be released with each release of the Dolphin Platform:

* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-lazybones-templates[Dolphin Platform Lazybones template for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-spring-boot-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a Spring
based jumpstart]
* https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-kumuluz-archetype[Dolphin Platform Maven archetype for a JavaEE
based jumpstart]

Based on this seperation a release for the Dolphin Platform is more complex than a release for a framework that is based
on one single repository.

There are 2 different release types for the Dolphin Platform:
* The regular (major) release introduces new features and / or bugfixes. We currently try to create such a release in a
periode of 2 weeks. This release will be created from the master branches of all repositories.
* A bugfix (minor) release provides a critical bugfix and will be created based on a regular /major Dolphin Platform
release. This release will normally be based on the release branch of the major release.


== Install needed tools for the release
TODO: some tools must be installed on the local machine. Add overview for all tools

== Major Release of the Dolphin Platform

This chapter describes how a new major release for the Dolphin Platform can be created.

When doing a major release of the Dolphin Platform the first or second number in the version number should be updates.
Based on this the next major release after `0.9.0` will be `0.10.0` and after `1.2.0` the next release will be `1.3.0`.

For a release the repositories shoud be released in a defined order to create a accurate release. The following
documentation shows a step by step instruction to release all repositories. In general a release starts by releasing
the sources of the JavaScript API repositores followed by the Java repository. Once this is done the jumpstart related
repositories can be released in any order.

==== Releasing the JavaScript repositories
A developer should always start to release the *JavaScript basic API*. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-js[JavaScript basic API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`)
* Check out the created release branch
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project
* If the build executes without any error the new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json`, `sonar-project.properties`
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the JavaScript basic API has been released

As a next step the *Poylmer API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-polymer[Polymer API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* The dependency of the Dolphin Platform JS client must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `bower update` command must be called to update all bower dependencies
* The new version number for the release must be specified in the following
files: `bower.json`, `package.json` and `sonar-project.properties`
* As a next step the project must be build by using gulp. To do so call `gulp clean verify build` in the root
folder of the project.
* If the build is running commit all changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`)
* Check out the created release branch
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the Polymer basic API has been released

As a next step the *AngularJS API* can be released. To do so several steps are needed:

* The https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform-angularjs[AngularJS API repository] must be check out on the local
machine
* Check out the master branch
* The dependency of the Dolphin Platform JS client must be set to the new version in the `bower.json` file
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `npm install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the npm dependencies
* If a developer has checked out the repository for the first time he needs to call `bower install` in
the root folder of the repository to install all the bower dependencies
* In the root folder of the project the `npm update` command must be called to update all npm dependencies

folder of the project.
* If the build is running commit all changes to master
* Create a new branch `release/VERSION` where `VERSION` defines the version that should be released (like `release/0.10.x`)
* Check out the created release branch
* Once this is done the current state must be tagged in git. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Once the tag is uploaded to the global repository at GitHub the AngularJS basic API has been released


==== Releasing the Java repository
* update the dependencies of all JavaScript modules in the `platform-examples` folder to the new version
* Try all examples
* check the changelog for current release in the documentation if all changes are mentioned
* Commit the changes to master

must be configured in the gradle.properties file (`/userHome/.gradle/gradle.properties`). Add the properties `bintrayUsername` and `bintrayApiKey` to the file.
* Create a tag from the release branch. The name of the tag must match the version of the new
release like `0.10.0`
* Upload the tag is to the global repository at GitHub
* If this release changed the first number in the version number (like 1.X.X -> 2.X.X) we need to update the SNAPSHOT version in the master
* Login to Bintray and publish all artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central

* Update version number in main `pom.xml`
*  Call `mvn clean deploy` from the project folder. For step the bintray user name and api token
  must be configured in the `.m2/setting.xml` Maven setting file.

release like `0.10.0`
* Upload the tag is to the global repository at GitHub
* Login to Bintray and publish all artifacts to JCenter and Maven Central

==== General release steps

* Next to the release of the software the version numbers of the latest stable should be updated in tutorials and
readme.md files of the repos.
* Create a release in GitHub (see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/releases[releases]) with the name of the
released version and copy the changelog for the new version in it
* The milestone in github must be closed (see https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/milestones[milestones])

== Minor Release of the Dolphin Platform

This chapter describes how a new minor release for the Dolphin Platform can be created.

When doing a major release of the Dolphin Platform the third number in the version number should be updates.
